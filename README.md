# improvement.py
The improvement.py library is a collection of functions designed to facilitate the removal of `routine` and `assignable` causes of variation from business and industrial processes. It is part of the larger body of work called Data Driven Improvement (DDI). The aim of DDI is to expand the use of Statistical Process Control.
